Decision Tree Classifier for Purchase Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project where a Decision Tree Classifier was built to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model uses customer attributes to identify patterns and predict purchase behavior, aiming to provide insights into key factors influencing customer purchasing decisions.

Project Overview

Objective: To predict customer purchase behavior and gain insights into the factors influencing these decisions.

Model: Decision Tree Classifier.

Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.


Dataset

The dataset includes:

Demographic Data: e.g., Age, Income, Gender.

Behavioral Data: e.g., Previous Purchases, Time Spent on Site.


> Note: This dataset has been cleaned and prepared for training by handling missing values, renaming columns for clarity, and selecting relevant features.



Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning:

Addressed missing values and refined the dataset to improve model accuracy.



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized relationships between features and identified patterns in customer demographics and behavior.



3. Feature Selection:

Selected relevant features to improve model accuracy and reduce noise in the data.



4. Model Building:

Built a Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-Learn, focusing on tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance.



5. Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure it meets the desired performance level.




Results

The Decision Tree Classifier achieved strong performance, providing reliable predictions and uncovering factors that significantly impact customer purchase behavior. The results can inform strategies to target customers effectively.

Lessons Learned

Data Cleaning and Preparation are essential for building a reliable model.

EDA helps in uncovering patterns and relationships that influence customer behavior.

Feature Selection is critical for model accuracy and interpretability.

Decision Trees offer interpretability, making them valuable for understanding which factors drive purchase decisions.
